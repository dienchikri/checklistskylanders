This is a personal website created to keep track of my collection.
The website uses a database for a secure login system and for storing which items are still missing.

The design is simple and responsive, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
The character names are linked to their images through code.

The site includes a search function, options to expand everything, show all images, a night mode, and a progress bar.
